#Dijkstra
*** 
Advantage:
    It is an application of greedy algorithm to solve the shortest
path problem from single source point to other vertices.And its
time complexity is O（n2).

Inferiority:
    It can only be used in graphs with positive edge weights.
****


#A*
*** 
advantage:
    A*(A-Star) algorithm is the most effective direct search method for
finding the shortest path in static road network.

Inferiority:
    The algorithm is computationally intensive and requires a lot of extra space
while the number of nodes is large.
****


#Floyd
*** 
advantage:
    Floyd algorithm is a classical dynamic programming algorithm. It is an
algorithm to solve the shortest path between any two points (called 
multi-source shortest path problem).
    It can be used in graphs with both positive and negative edge weights.

Inferiority:
Time complexity is O（n3).
